## 🧠 Overview

**Plex-Earth** is an advanced AutoCAD extension that connects CAD workflows with real-world geographic data. It allows users to import satellite imagery, terrain models, and map services directly into AutoCAD drawings, bridging the gap between design and geospatial information.

The software enables professionals to work with high-resolution imagery and elevation data without leaving the AutoCAD environment. This integration simplifies site planning, infrastructure design, and large-scale development projects where accurate geographic context is essential.

With tools for coordinate system management and terrain processing, Plex-Earth supports precise positioning and realistic surface modeling. Designers can generate contours, analyze elevations, and align project data with real-world coordinates efficiently.

By combining mapping technology with drafting tools, Plex-Earth enhances project visualization and improves decision-making during the planning and design stages.
